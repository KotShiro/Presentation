					<h3>In this post I would like to tell a short history of such fundamental things for understanding the WEB as WWW, HTML and CSS.</h3>
					So let's get started.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						how did it all start?
					</h3>

					<p>
						The world's first Internet site was presented to the world in August 1991 by British scientist Timothy Berners-Lee at
						<a href="http://info.cern.ch/">http://info.cern.ch/</a>, now the site is <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">archived</a>.

						<h3>
							who started?
						</h3>
						<img class="r-frame" style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1); text-align: center;" width="178" height="238" data-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Sir_Tim_Berners-Lee_%28cropped%29.jpg/240px-Sir_Tim_Berners-Lee_%28cropped%29.jpg" alt="Sir_Tim_Berners-Lee">
						<p>
							Timothy John Berners-Lee<br>
							from the UK. He was born on June 8, 1955 in London.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Global Web project. WWW</h3>
						<p>
							The place of work that played a decisive role in the fate of 
							Tim, and indeed of all mankind, is the European Laboratory for 
							Nuclear Research (CERN), located in Geneva (Switzerland). 
							There, Berners-Lee developed the Inquire program, which used the 
							method of random associations.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							The main goal of Tim's program was to publish hypertext documents that could be referenced. This simplifies the search for information, its organization and storage. 
							The project was originally planned to be implemented on the CERN intranet for local research needs in alternative data stores. At the same time, data download and access 
							to them were possible from any computer connected to the WWW.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Work on the project lasted from 1991 to 1993. In particular, the first versions of the URL protocols (as a special case of URIs), HTTP and HTML were already proposed at that time. Also introduced was the first hypertext-based World Wide Web browser and WYSIWYG editor.
						</p>
						<p>
							One of the fixes for the WWW has always been node decentralization. Like the ancestors of the Internet (ARPANET and NSFNet), it provides reliable operation, without geographical boundaries and barriers.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							HTML
						</h3>
						<p>
							As I said earlier, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is intended for marking and formatting documents generated while working on the Global Web project.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							HTML is the successor to SGML, but it was created to be used by non-typesetters. Thus, from the early days, HTML has the following benefits:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Simplicity - due to a small set of structural elements - descriptors (they are also "tags"). All tags are written in angle brackets, for example. <..tag..> and carry some kind of semantic load
								</li>
								<li>
									Ability to format a document without reference to display means (be it a computer monitor, a phone screen or a reader)
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						1993 - HTML 1.2
					</h3>
					<p>
						In this version, out of more than forty tags, 3 tags have appeared, which hint at some kind of visual design of the document (for example, bold italic). The rest of the tags were used exclusively for logical markup.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						1994 - Founding of W3C
					</h3>
					<p>
						Sir Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (World Wide Web Consortium, W3C). The mission of the W3C was and remains to "unleash the full potential of the World Wide Web by establishing protocols and principles for the long-term development of the network." It's a huge credit to these guys that HTML was released with one basic set of tags and attributes, and web pages became what we know today.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						1995 - Version 2.0
					</h3>
					<p>
						The process and approval of the new version was very leisurely, the only noticeable improvement in the new version:
						Queries: For example, keyword searches.
						Forms for transferring data from computer to server: enter your date of birth or select one of the options in the questionnaire.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						1995 - Beginning of work on HTML 3.0.
					</h3>
					<p>
						The first version of the standard included many interesting things:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>tags for creating tables,</li>
						<li>markup of mathematical formulas,</li>
						<li>text wrapping, etc.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The authors suddenly remembered that, in theory, HTML should only mark up the document and should not contain parameters for the graphic styles of displaying elements in the browser. From what followed the decision to add support for a new tool served to design web pages.
					</p>

					<section>
						<h3>
							December 1996 - CSS
						</h3>
						<p>
							CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Representing views of parts of a document.
						</p>
						<p>
							So the CSS system:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>does not formally depend on HTML,</li>
							<li>has its own non-HTML syntax,</li>
							<li>It is not bound by the ideological limitations of HTML,</li>
							<li>Allows you to set the appearance options for any HTML tag.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							With the CSS web page builder, you can finally change the font and size of anything, and, importantly, this is not made possible by introducing new tags, but by using a mechanism that affects the interpretation of already used HTML tags. ...
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						1997 - HTML 3.2
					</h3>
					<p>
						Version 3.2 came out a month after CSS was approved and has already been fully adapted for interacting with stylesheets.
					</p>
					<p>
						It omits many of the 3.0 features, but adds non-standard elements supported by Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer 3.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						1997 - HTML 4.0
					</h3>
					<p>
						In this version, elements from previous versions have been pretty much cleaned up. Many tags have been recommended as deprecated and deprecated. Instead, it was necessary to use CSS style sheets. The new version included support for frames, scripts, general support for various objects.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						1999 - HTML 4.01
					</h3>
					<p>
						In this version, we slightly tweaked objects, shapes and images, fixed bugs and generally created a more stable version using web developers for over 10 years.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						October 28, 2014 - HTML5
					</h3>
					<p>
						From that day on, the W3C officially recommends using HTML5.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The new version has made the syntax stricter than the previous one,</li>
						<li>Improved support for multimedia technologies</li>
						<li>Added 28 new structural elements to make the code more understandable</li>
						<li>Some more obsolete tags have been removed</li>
						<li>More attention is paid to supporting scripts, for example javascript</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

						At the moment, HTML development continues ...
